# Odin

I created Odin out of frustration with the current ecosystem of reference managers and their lack of integration with my daily research activities. I would often find myself working on a code library with all of the right reference pdfs, websites, and datafiles open, only to lose progress the next day when attempting to get back to that sweet spot. I wanted a system that would do the following:

- Allow for quick note taking on any document in my library.
- Allow for quick access to notes related to any document in my library.
- Define relations between any note, reference, or any other file.
- Plot (maybe eventually navigate through) a relational graph of all items.
- Operate from the command line and with vim bindings.
- Fuzzy finder for all items
- Tag anything
    - Search by tags
- Maintain a master BibTex library
- Automatically search documents for identifiers like DOI or ArXivID and add them to the master BibTex library.
